# Increment Notes

* [15 February](#date-15-february)
* [17 February](#date-17-february)

### Date: 15 February

#### What did we achieve?

* We've downloaded the CheXpert data from Stanford containing 400+ gb of chest x-ray scans (~250.000 scans)
* We've set up a template for our thesis in Overleaf and gotten BibTex up and running with the papers we've touched so far
* We've gotten the GitHub infrastructure up to acceptable standards and added notes for the weekly increments

#### What did we struggle with?

* We had a hard time figuring out what data to use and how much we need
* It has been tough figuring out formal requirements? How long should the bachelor be, what style should the document be, what is required information?
* Which direction do we want to go in first and work up from?
* Which ML library should we use?

#### What would we like to work on next time?

* We would like to get an idea of the direction we want to go in - and start writing some code and explore the data
* We want to formalize a concrete research question to aid us in our work
* We want to make a plan for what we need to implement when
* We want to define what a hidden feature in relation to our research
* Read "Hidden Stratification Causes Clinically Meaningful
Failures in Machine Learning for Medical Imaging" and generate ideas

### Date: 17 February

#### What did we achieve?

* Found repositories containing models for classifying pathologies
* Read "Hidden Stratification Causes Clinically Meaningful Failures in Machine Learning for Medical Imaging" and generate ideas
* Set up a coding environment where we can work together in the editor üéâ

#### What did we struggle with?

* Finding the definitions for the different columns in the .csv-file for the data üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

#### What would we like to work on next time?

* Use the models we found, and see if we can recreate the results
* Create a subset of the data with only pneumothorax
* Make a test case for one condition (pneumothorax) and one hidden feature (tube)
