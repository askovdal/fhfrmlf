# Weekly Meeting Notes

* [15 February 2022](#date-15-february-2022)

### Date: 15 February 2022

#### What did we achieve?

* We've downloaded the CheXpert data from Stanford containing 400+ gb of chest x-ray scans (~250.000 scans)
* We've set up a template for our thesis in Overleaf and gotten BibTex up and running with the papers we've touched so far
* We've gotten the GitHub infrastructure up to acceptable standards and added notes for the weekly increments

#### What did we struggle with?

* We had a hard time figuring out what data to use and how much we need
* It has been tough figuring out formal requirements? How long should the bachelor be, what style should the document be, what is required information?
* Which direction do we want to go in first and work up from?

#### What would we like to work on next week?

* We would like to get an idea of the direction we want to go in - and start writing some code and explore the data
* We want to formalize a concrete research question to aid us in our work
* We want to make a plan for what we need to implement when
